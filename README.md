grunt-jshint-bfs [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jgable/grunt-jshint-bfs.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jgable/grunt-jshint-bfs)
================

A better, faster and stronger version of the grunt-contrib-jshint task.

### Why?

The existing grunt-contrib-jshint task at the time of this writing is hard to change and has limited unit tests.  Rather than work the required large changes into their existing codebase I've decided to make this as an example and hopefully have them adopt the practices from here.
