grunt jshint2 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jgable/grunt-jshint2.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jgable/grunt-jshint2)
================

The task I want the [grunt-contrib-jshint](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint) task to be.

### Why another one?

I [offered to merge](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint/issues/45) but they didn't seem interested in saving puppies.
